# 2048

For my final project, I plan on recreating the game 2048. I chose this game because it is a game I have always enjoyed, and creating a game with clean graphics has been a goal of mine. I do not have that much background knowledge about building games besides the games that we have done in class, but I am excited to learn something new. Some features I would like my game to have are obviously the game functionality, music, light/dark mode, and a move count and stopwatch that times how long it takes for the user to reach the 2048 tile. 

To complete this project, I will need to use the [GFlags](https://gflags.github.io/gflags/) library. I have checked to make sure that this is compatible with my OS. This library will help me render graphics and text for my game. To store game data, I will use [SQLite3](https://github.com/SqliteModernCpp/sqlite_modern_cpp/tree/dev). I will also need to use Cinder libraries such as [KeyEvent](https://libcinder.org/docs/classcinder_1_1app_1_1_key_event.html), [Audio](https://libcinder.org/docs/namespacecinder_1_1audio.html), [Timer](https://libcinder.org/docs/classcinder_1_1_timer.html), and maybe some others.

The goal for my first week of working on this project is to set up the GUI and begin implementing the graphics for my game. The goal for my second week is to implement my game and begin integrating it with my GUI. By the end of the third week, I want to have the game fully functioning with features such as a move count, light/dark mode, and stopwatch implemented.

A stretch goal that I could implement if I finish early is a file with all the user scores written using json, or a leaderboard database that displays a users high scores, similar to the database in our snake project.
